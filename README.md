📘 Comprehensive Description

This experiment investigates how a multi-agent system behaves under sudden failures and stress conditions. Each agent operates independently yet contributes to the overall performance of the collective environment. By introducing controlled failures and recovery mechanisms, the simulation examines the stability, adaptability, and resilience of the system. The goal is to understand how intelligent systems maintain functionality and balance during unexpected disruptions without centralized control.

🧠 Objective

To evaluate the emergency response and recovery efficiency of a decentralized system by:
• Measuring how agents fail and recover dynamically.
• Analyzing collective performance stability over repeated disruptions.
• Demonstrating self-organizing behavior through autonomous task redistribution.

✏️ Results

The experiment revealed that the system achieved a recovery rate exceeding 70% after ten iterations. Despite initial instability, agents learned to restore balance collectively, reflecting principles of adaptive intelligence. Cooperative agents contributed to maintaining operational continuity, while competitive agents optimized local recovery decisions. Together, they produced emergent stability that mirrors the behavior of real-world distributed systems.

📗 Observations

• The system demonstrates dynamic resilience under repeated stress.
• Self-healing behavior emerges without external supervision.
• Performance improves over iterations due to collective learning.
• The experiment validates the potential of adaptive, decentralized AI for real-world emergency response systems.
